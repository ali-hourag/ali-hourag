  <h2>🛠️ Current Job:</h2>
</div>
<p>
  💻 I'm currently working as a Full Stack developer applying the latest technologies in a SaaS platform for blockain-based authentication.
  <br/>
  -  Build scalable and maintainable components from scratch with React and Tailwind, using different libraries such as Zustand for state management, Framer Motion for dynamic and aesthetically pleasing user interactions in components such as Drap and Drop functionalities, sorting menus, dropdowns and more, getting to enhance my UX/UI and sharpen my abilities in clean code, specially modularization and scabalibility.
  <br/>
-  Testing components with Jest and React testing, as well as storybook implementation for better component development in isolation.
  <br/>
-  Responsiveness for all devices.
  <br/>
- I am developing a Chrome extension with interactions with the dashboard and ddbb throughout the web socket.
  <br/>
- Websocket interaction through events so that we can get bidirectional communication between the Front-End and the Back-End.
  <br/>
- Docker and Bash scripting to streamline my development environment. I am also using tools like Temuxinator to maintain a smooth workflow and eliminate potential hiccups.

<h2 align="center">🌱 Learning Journey</h2>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>I started my journey 2 years ago, when I got involved in a computer science degree in the University of Alcalá, in which I learnt a lot about proactivity, mental agility, working under pressure and problem solving. I studied the fundamentals of programming and databases in programming langauges like Python, Java and PostgreSQL. Not only that, but I also built a strong background in mathematics and statistics, using softwares like R.</li>
    <li>Even though I was performing well and I was at the top of my classes, I was searching for something more practical and quick. For that same reason, I was introduced to the masters of Software Development in <a href="https://assemblerinstitute.com/cursos/master-in-software-development-remoto/?utm_medium=paidsearch&utm_source=google.com&utm_campaign=branding&_gl=1*17nx2zf*_up*MQ..&gclid=CjwKCAjws9ipBhB1EiwAccEi1NCrFz8_n3tI30pdcLOORmVdKUsqsO7dGpoedFZ4kIYLnQRiNZfzShoCMW8QAvD_BwE">Assembler Institute of Technology</a> in which I was +1200 hours working in a real life environment with real projects and based on a "learning by doing" methodology.</li>
    <li>After seeing that, it was a no brainer for me. I joined Assembler and now, after finishing it I am on the lookout for an opportunity to start working in a good team with challenging projects in which I can learn, grow and contribute.</li>
    <li>I will be finishing my Computer Science degree part-timely and remotely in the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya starting on February 2024.</li>
    <li>Aside for my academic studies, I have always been learning and involving myself in Artificial Intelligence, best practices, Agile Methodologies like Scrum, blockchain technology. Basically keeping up with new technologies and never stop gaining knowledge!</li>
    <li>At Assembler I learnt about Front End technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React, API requests and Next.js, always implementing different libraries like react-hook form.<br/> With regards to the Back End, we learnt about server-based technologies like Node.js and Express.js, using Mongoose or ORM like Prisma to connect it to the database, created with Mongodb or Prisma, locally and using different cloud services, like MongoDB Atlas and vercel storage.<br/>Different resources like Auth0 and Cloudinary were used for authentication and cloud storage.<br/> Finally, we learnt about testing in with Jest and React-Testing-Library and deployement with Vercel.</li>
