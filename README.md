- 👀 Hi! I am a Fullstack Developer with a strong affinity for logic, creativity and clean code. Very driven and determined to achieve my goals and constantly striving to be better, more efficient and faster.
- 🌱 Due to my Computer Science degree and Software Development master I have enhanced my problem solving ability, my proactivity and I have become a great team-player with the necessary skills to work independently.
- 💞️ I am on the lookout for new opportunities to contribute to a team, as well as taking on responsibilities and carrying out challenging projects that will help me grow, learn and add value to the company by being an important asset.

  <h2>🛠️ Current Project:</h2>
</div>
<p>
  💻 I'm currently working together with my team in <a href="https://assemblerinstitute.com/"><b></b>Assembler Institute</b></a> on a music app, that resembles Spotify, but with some built-in functionalities like being able to upload your own tracks and albums, either publicly or privately, just like SounCloud!
  The project is done in React + TypeScript with Vite.js for the front end, and PostgreSQL + Express + Prisma using Node for the back end, integrating Auth0 for user authentication and Cloudinary for asset storage, among other libraries and resources.

<h2 align="center">🌱 Learning Journey</h2>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>I started my journey 2 years ago, when I got involved in a computer science degree in the University of Alcalá, in which I learnt a lot about proactivity, mental agility, working under pressure and problem solving. I studied the fundamentals of programming and databases in programming langauges like Python, Java and PostgreSQL. Not only that, but I also built a strong background in mathematics and statistics, using softwares like R.</li>
  </ul>
