- 👀 I’m interested in software development and artificial intelligence.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about testing with Jest and Cypress, GraphQL and Apollo Server.
- 💞️ I am on the lookout for new opportunities to contribute to a team, as well as taking on responsibilities and carrying out challenging projects that will help me grow, learn and add value to the company by being an important asset.

- 💻 I'm currently working together with my team at <a href="https://assemblerinstitute.com/"><b></b>Assembler Institute</b></a> on a music app, that resembles Spotify, but with some built-in functionalities like being able to upload your own music, either publicly or privately, just like SounCloud.
  The project is done in React + TypeScript with Vite.js for the front end, and PostgreSQL + Express + Prisma using Node for the back end, integrating @Auth0 for user authentication and Cloudinary for asset storage, among other libraries and resources.
  We are implementing testing and it will soon be deployed by Vercel!
