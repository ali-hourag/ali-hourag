  <h2>🛠️ Current Project:</h2>
</div>
<p>
  💻 I'm currently working together with my team in <a href="https://assemblerinstitute.com/"><b></b>Assembler Institute</b></a> on a music app, that resembles Spotify, but with some built-in functionalities like being able to upload your own tracks and albums, either publicly or privately, just like SounCloud!
  The project is done in React + TypeScript with Vite.js for the front end, and PostgreSQL + Express + Prisma using Node for the back end, integrating Auth0 for user authentication and Cloudinary for asset storage, among other libraries and resources.
  <br/>

<h2 align="center">🌱 Learning Journey</h2>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>I started my journey 2 years ago, when I got involved in a computer science degree in the University of Alcalá, in which I learnt a lot about proactivity, mental agility, working under pressure and problem solving. I studied the fundamentals of programming and databases in programming langauges like Python, Java and PostgreSQL. Not only that, but I also built a strong background in mathematics and statistics, using softwares like R.</li>
    <li>Even though I was performing well and I was at the top of my classes, I was searching for something more practical and quick. For that same reason, I was introduced to the masters of Software Development in <a href="https://assemblerinstitute.com/cursos/master-in-software-development-remoto/?utm_medium=paidsearch&utm_source=google.com&utm_campaign=branding&_gl=1*17nx2zf*_up*MQ..&gclid=CjwKCAjws9ipBhB1EiwAccEi1NCrFz8_n3tI30pdcLOORmVdKUsqsO7dGpoedFZ4kIYLnQRiNZfzShoCMW8QAvD_BwE">Assembler Institute of Technology</a> in which I was +1200 hours working in a real life environment with real projects and based on a "learning by doing" methodology.</li>
    <li>After seeing that, it was a no brainer for me. I joined Assembler and now, after finishing it I am on the lookout for an opportunity to start working in a good team with challenging projects in which I can learn, grow and contribute.</li>
    <li>I will be finishing my Computer Science degree part-timely and remotely in the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya starting on February 2024.</li>
    <li>Aside for my academic studies, I have always been learning and involving myself in Artificial Intelligence, best practices, Agile Methodologies like Scrum, blockchain technology. Basically keeping up with new technologies and never stop gaining knowledge!</li>
    <li>At Assembler I learnt about Front End technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React, API requests and Next.js, always implementing different libraries like react-hook form.<br/> With regards to the Back End, we learnt about server-based technologies like Node.js and Express.js, using Mongoose or ORM like Prisma to connect it to the database, created with Mongodb or Prisma, locally and using different cloud services, like MongoDB Atlas and vercel storage.<br/>Different resources like Auth0 and Cloudinary were used for authentication and cloud storage.<br/> Finally, we learnt about testing in with Jest and React-Testing-Library and deployement with Vercel.</li>
  </ul>
